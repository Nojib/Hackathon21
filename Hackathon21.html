        <ul>
            <li>Maintain at least a 1-metre distance between yourself and others to reduce your risk of infection when
                they cough, sneeze or speak. Maintain an even greater distance between yourself and others when indoors.
                The further away, the better</li>
            <li>Make wearing a mask a normal part of being around other people. The appropriate use, storage and
                cleaning or disposal are essential to make masks as effective as possible</li>

        <h2>Why should I get vaccinated?</h2>

        <p>By getting vaccinated, you are helping protect yourself, your family and your friends. You are also helping
            make your community safer. In clinical studies, both Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were more than 94%
            effective at protecting participants from COVID-19. They were also shown to be safe and that you cannot get
            COVID-19 from them.</p>
